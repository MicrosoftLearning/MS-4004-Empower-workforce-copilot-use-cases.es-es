### Linking files in Copilot

In this exercise, you direct Copilot in Word to write a speech for you based on your company's Income Statement, which is stored in a Word document. As you may recall from earlier training, when you link a file such as this into a Copilot prompt, the file MUST be located in a OneDrive account. You can't link to a locally stored file on your PC.

You can link the file into the Copilot prompt using one of the following methods:

 -  Select the file from the Most Recently Used (MRU) file list.
 -  Open the file and copy its path using the **Share** option, then paste the path into the prompt following the forward slash (/).
 -  Copy the file's path from File Explorer and paste it into the prompt following the forward slash (/).

In this exercise, you select the company's Income Statement from the MRU file list.

### Exercise

As the CFO at Fabrikam, Inc., an IT services firm located in Minneapolis, MN, you're meeting next week with the company's major shareholders to provide a presentation on the company's 2023 year-end financial performance. Your VP of Accounting provided you with a summary of the company's Income Statement.

You plan to use Copilot to write your speech based on the financial results outlined in the Income Statement. This exercise walks you through a series of prompts that you can use to have Copilot in Word generate your speech and then update it based on your suggested changes.

To reference the file in Copilot, this exercise locates the file from the MRU file list.

Perform the following steps to generate your speech using Copilot in Word:

1.  Select the following link to download a copy of [Fabrikam's 2023 Income Statement](https://edxinteractivepage.blob.core.windows.net/ms-4004/Fabrikam%202023%20Income%20Statement.docx).
2.  Once the download is complete, open **File Explorer** and move the file from your **Downloads** folder to a folder in your OneDrive account.
3.  In this exercise, you access the document from the MRU file list. To get the file to appear in the list, open the document and then close it.
4.  In **Microsoft 365**, open a new blank **Microsoft Word** document by entering the following URL: **Word.new** 
5.  In the **Draft with Copilot** window that appears at the top of the blank document, enter the following prompt:
    
    **Write a speech for the Fabrikam stakeholders that summarizes the results of the company's 2023 income statement found in the attached file**.
6.  In the **Draft with Copilot** window, select the **Reference your content** button. In the drop-down menu that appears, select **Browse files from cloud**.
7.  In the **Pick a file** window that appears, under the **Recent** file list, select the **Fabrikam 2023 Income Statement.docx** file and then select the **Attach** button. Note how the file is displayed in the prompt.
8.  Select **Generate**. At this point, Copilot extracts the financial results from the Income Statement and drafts a speech. After reviewing the speech, you decide that it's a good starting point, although there are a few areas that you want to modify.
9.  In the Copilot window at the end of the speech, select the **Keep it** button.
10. You want to begin by reviewing any changes suggested by the Copilot Editor. Select the **Editor** icon that appears in the menu bar at the top of the page.
11. In the **Editor** pane that appears, note the categories that appear under the **Corrections** or **Refinements** sections that display a number (indicating the number of issues for that category). These issues are often linked to the tone of the writing style used in the document.
12. Below the **Editor Score** is a field that allows you to select the tone used when writing the speech. It currently displays **Formal writing**, which is the default tone that Copilot used when writing this speech. When you don't indicate what writing style to use in your prompt, **Formal writing** is the default tone that Copilot uses. Select this field to see your options. You prefer a professional sounding tone, so select **Professional** from the drop-down menu. Note whether the **Editor Score** changes.
13. In the categories that appear under the **Corrections** or **Refinements** sections, you can review the changes that occurred in the categories based on changing the writing style from Formal to Professional. Select each category that displays a number (indicating the number of issues for that category). Doing so enables you to review the suggestions throughout the document for that category. For each suggestion, select either the suggested change or select **Ignore**. Repeat this process until all categories display a check mark.
14. For curiosity sake, change the writing style to **Casual**. Note whether the **Editor Score** changes. If any categories display a number, review the category and see what the Editor flagged. You want to keep the writing style as Professional, so select **Ignore** any suggested changes. Review all the suggested changes to see the differences that were flagged between Professional and Casual styles.
15. Save the file to your OneDrive account with the following file name: **Fabrikam 2023 Financial presentation.docx**. The next exercise uses this document.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Ensure that you save the file to your OneDrive rather than your local PC. In the next exercise, you use Copilot in PowerPoint to create a slide presentation based on this document. The document must be in OneDrive for Copilot to access it.
16. Close the tab containing this document in your Microsoft Edge browser.
